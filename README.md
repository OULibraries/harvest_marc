# OU Recipe Tools

Internal scripts to prepare recipe files and metadata for importing items from our File Archive to our Islandora repository. You probably don't care about this if you don't work for OU Libraries. 

Requires:

* [ramsey/uuid](https://github.com/ramsey/uuid)
* [GuzzleHttp](http://guzzle.readthedocs.org/)

Use composer to get them.
